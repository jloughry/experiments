eicargen
========

My version of a programme by Didier Stevens that writes the EICAR standard
anti-virus test file in the current directory. The reason this programme
exists is because sometimes it's hard to get the EICAR file onto a system
for testing, as anti-virus defences are primed to look for it. As a second
layer of protection, this programme if run with no command line arguments
does nothing; only if run with the argument 'write' will it generate the
file.
