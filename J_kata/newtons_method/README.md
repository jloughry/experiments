newtons_method
==============

Find the square root of 443556 by Newton's method (actually, not strictly
Newton-Rafson iteration, since that requires finding the derivative, but
this method converges pretty rapidly, roughly doubling the number of bits
of precision each iteration. It needs about 11 iterations to get within
1e-9 of the correct value.
